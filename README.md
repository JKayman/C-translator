# C-translator
This program translates plain text into pieces of code in C language. Every number in the given text will be treated as an integer type. If executed they will print out the original text.

The program creates a .txt file in the project's directory with the resulting code.. If the file with the given name already exists it will be overwritten.

'src' contains the source code.
'win' contains executable python file for windows.

The motivation for this program was to check the correctness of CS homework.
